# Clemens AP Computer Science Samples
These are the assignments I've completed for my AP Computer Science class in my junior year of high
school. If you plan to plagiarize, **don't**. My experience makes it obvious I've been programming 
for a while. It will be obvious you are copy-pasting code and don't know what you're doing.

## Usage
To simply run the labs, open IntelliJ in the root directory and run the configuration for the lab
that needs to be run; the run configuration will automatically generate the class files. Without 
IntelliJ, use the `javac` compiler to build the `com.thecraftkid.apcs` package into the `build/`
folder and use the `java` CLI tools to run the generated class files.

## Other notes
While Java's standard convention is to capitalize class names, I couldn't do so as my teacher
required lab names in a certain format (last name + first initial + lab number). I could, however,
capitalize other class names when classes were necessary, so I followed convention in those 
situations.
